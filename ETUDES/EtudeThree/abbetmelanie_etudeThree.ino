/********************** ETUDE 3 CART 360 2019 *******************************
 * WELCOME! 
 * THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXERCISE IS TO DESIGN A VERY SIMPLE KEYBOARD (5 KEYS)
 * WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO PLAY LIVE, RECORD, AND PLAYBACK SINGLE NOTES (NO CHORDS). 
 * THERE WILL BE A BUTTON WHICH WHEN PRESSED WILL TAKE THE USER TO THE NEXT MODE:
 * THERE ARE 5 POSSIBLE MODES
 * 0 ==  reset    ==   led off == also resets
 * 1 ==  live     ==   led BLUE
 * 2 ==  record   ==   led RED
 * 3 ==  play     ==   led GREEN
 * 4 ==  loopMODE ==   led PURPLE
 * 
 * ADDITIONALLY - WHEN THE USER CHANGES MODE, 
 * THE RGB LED WILL CHANGE COLOR (ACCORDING TO THE SPECIFICATIONS)

 * PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE COMMENTS:
 * DO NOT ADD ANY MORE FUNCTION DEFINITIONS 
 * ONLY IMPLEMENT THE FUNCTION DEFINITIONS SUPPLIED
 * THERE IS NO NEED TO ADD ANY NEW VARIABLES OR CONSTANTS
 * PROVIDE COMMENTS FOR ANY OF THE CODE IMPLEMENTED
 * GOOD LUCK!
 */
/**** CONSTANTS ********************************************************/

#define BUTTON_MODE_PIN 2 // Button to change the mode

// constants for RGB LED //change the colors pin because wasn't the good pin connected to

//constant for max number of notes in array
#define MAX_NOTES 16

// a constant for duration

 * 1: chooseMode(): this function will determine the mode that your program is in 
 * based on if the button (linked to the BUTTON_MODE_PIN) was pressed
 * 2: setRGB(): will set the color of the RGB LED based on the value of the mode variable
 * 3: selectMode(): will determine which function to call based on the value of the mode variable

 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 * Read the value from the Button (linked to the BUTTON_MODE_PIN) and 
 * if is being pressed then change the mode variable.
 * REMEMBER:
 * mode == 0 is reset 
 * mode == 1 is live
 * mode == 2 is record
 * mode == 3 is play
 * mode == 4 is loopMode
 * Every time the user presses the button, the program will go to the next mode,
 * once it reaches 4, it should go back to mode == 0. 
 * (i.e. if mode ==2 and we press, then mode ==3) ...

/******************************Comment on the Etude********************************************
I join the RGB wire differently than in the schematics where there miss a connection between the two part of the board
Then I first get some problem with the board, I realize I forgot to add connection to the A0 pin

The first things I programm was the colors I get struggle because I put the value as HIGH and LOW as we are in a situation (analog where a value between 0-255 was needed)
Second the Led was not showing the right color so I change the number of the pin connected so that my mode correspond to the right color

I tried different resistor, the best match Ifound was a mix of 10KOhm and 300Ohm with the 10K resistor the sound were really deep
and similar. Putting a higher resistance at the start change just the first sound to something deep and at the end all the button before the resistance
With the 100K Ohm the sound just could not get trought.
I get some struggle with the button in mode 3 and 4, I resolute it to a certain extend with the delay but it is not perfect.
